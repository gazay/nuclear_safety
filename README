Very old sources of my diploma project for solving problem of nuclear safety. This script solves system of equations, which describes all elements of complex system. 


Need to refactoring all code. It was lazy programming with variables the same as in equations. s - state, m - mass etc.

TODO:
1. Replace all variables with readable full names.
2. Organize classes in right structure.
3. Write full instructions in README
